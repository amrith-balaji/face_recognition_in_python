## Importing Opencv :
You will need this library for running the code. There are two main ways to install OpenCV for Python:

1. Using pip:
   
   ``` pip install opencv-python ```
   
   This is the simplest way to install OpenCV. It will automatically download and install the appropriate version of OpenCV for your platform.

3. Building from source:
   
   If you need a specific version of OpenCV or want to customize the build, you can build it from source. See the official OpenCV documentation for instructions: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

## Image and code :
1. Take a picture of yourself and save the image in the same directory as the code.
2. edit the code using IDLE_python and replace "(replace with image name)" with the name of your image
3. Make sure that the image is in the .png format and not the .jpg format
4. press 'f5' to run the code
5. Voila !
