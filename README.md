# Importing Opencv :
You will need this library for running the code. There are two main ways to install OpenCV for Python:

1. Using pip:
   
   ``` pip install opencv-python ```
   
   This is the simplest way to install OpenCV. It will automatically download and install the appropriate version of OpenCV for your platform.

3. Building from source:
   
   If you need a specific version of OpenCV or want to customize the build, you can build it from source. See the official OpenCV documentation for instructions: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
